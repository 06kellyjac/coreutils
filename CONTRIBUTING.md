Contributing to coreutils
=========================

Contributions are very welcome, and should target Rust's master branch until the
standard libraries are stabilized. You may *claim* an item on the to-do list by
following these steps:

1. Open an issue named "Implement [the utility of your choice]", e.g. "Implement ls"
2. State that you are working on this utility.
3. Develop the utility.
4. Add integration tests.
5. Add the reference to your utility into Cargo.toml and Makefile.
6. Remove utility from the to-do list in the README.
7. Submit a pull request and close the issue.

The steps above imply that, before starting to work on a utility, you should search the issues to make sure no one else is working on it.
